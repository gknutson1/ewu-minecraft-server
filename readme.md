# Legacy ewu-mc

This is a dump of several of the components that made up the now-depreciated ewu-mc minecraft server and modpack. 

For the active and currently deployed modpack, see [gknutson1/ewu-mc](https://github.com/gknutson1/ewu-mc).

As it is depreciated, no updates or support will be provided for this modpack.

Various bits are stored in different branches:

the [worldbackup](https://github.com/gknutson1/legacy-ewu-mc/tree/worldbackup) branch holds an upload of the world save from April 20, 2022.

the [site](https://github.com/gknutson1/legacy-ewu-mc/tree/site) branch holds the old help page, with (now out-of-date) instructions on how to download and install the modpack.

the [server](https://github.com/gknutson1/legacy-ewu-mc/tree/server) branch holds the server code, for running your own instance of the modpack.

the [client](https://github.com/gknutson1/legacy-ewu-mc/tree/client) branch holds the client code, for connecting to a server running a modpack or playing the modpack locally.
